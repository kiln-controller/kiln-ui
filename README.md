# ðŸ”¥ kiln-ui

UI for the ESPHome based Kiln controller:
https://github.com/kiln-controller/esphome-kiln-api

See the above repository for the getting started with this.

## Demo

[https://kiln-controller.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/index.html](https://kiln-controller.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/index.html)

The status page will not work in the demo since there is no kiln connected. I might make a more functional demo at some point.
